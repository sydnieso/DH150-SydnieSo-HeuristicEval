#### Overview: 
Charity Miles is an application that allows users to select a charity in which they want to raise money for. Through various physical activities such as walking, running, and biking, the app tracks your activity and based on the distance reached, users will raise a certain amount of money for every mile achieved in each session.
#### Overall Evaluation:
The overall framework of the application is structured fairly well. There are various navigation components that could vastly improve the users experience. Many of the icons that indicate the different pages are unclear as to what they are supposed to represent. Error prevention is also something that could be improved on through the use of action confirmation and better accessibility to exit.
