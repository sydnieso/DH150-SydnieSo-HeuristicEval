#### Overview: 
Charity Miles is an application that allows users to select a charity in which they want to raise money for. Through various physical activities such as walking, running, and biking, the app tracks your activity and based on the distance reached, users will raise a certain amount of money for every mile achieved in each session.
#### Overall Evaluation:
The overall framework of the application is structured fairly well. There are various navigation components that could vastly improve the users experience. Many of the icons that indicate the different pages are unclear as to what they are supposed to represent. Error prevention is also something that could be improved on through the use of action confirmation and better accessibility to exit.

#### Heuristic Evaluation:
1. **Visibility of system status**
- When changing from various tabs on the navigation bar of the application, there is a circulating loading icon that pops up in the middle of the screen that circulates while the system is loading a page
- When opening one of the support pages in the Settings tab there is a small bar that states ‘Opening URL…’ 
- Both of these examples present issues because there is a lack of understanding as to how far along the system has loaded, since there is no fill that indicates the progress of loading

2. **Match between system and the real world**
- The icons on the main navigation bar are misleading and unclear as to what they are trying to indicate
- Descriptive words that are used in the Settings portion are clear and consise

3. **User control and freedom**
- When beginning an activity there is no confirmation of wanting to start it and there is no cancel button, instead you have to ‘Finish’ your activity
- When changing charities, after selecting a new charity a screen pops up asking whether or not the user is sure they want to make the change they are about to make
